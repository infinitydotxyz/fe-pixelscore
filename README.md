TODO:

1. use result from refresh on Pending item and update the list on screen
2. Search doesn't work well
3. Some of your NFTs are in the top 1%, pay to reveal
4. score NFTs that are not scored yet. show unscored?
5. dark home page, https://pixelverse.ai/, https://nft-avatars.webflow.io/
6. in the checkout flow, if someone tries to checkout NFTs whose ranks are already revealed (all NFTs whose pixel rank bucket < 10 and the ones with bucket 10 but pixelRankRevealed = true), checkout should show an error to remove already revealed items from cart (edited)
7. pending cards ugly
8. cart animation and relayout
9. missing image feature on BGImage
