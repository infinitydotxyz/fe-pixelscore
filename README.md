TODO:

1. use result from refresh on Pending item and update the list on screen
2. score NFTs that are not scored yet. show unscored?
3. dark home page, https://pixelverse.ai/, https://nft-avatars.webflow.io/
4. in the checkout flow, if someone tries to checkout NFTs whose pixel rank is already visible, checkout should show an error to remove them from cart (edited)
5. make left side cards nice
6. Reveal and ranks
7. Some of your NFTs are in the top 1%, pay to reveal
10. Remove sandbox page and route
11. Spinner is ugly - use spinner from Infinity
12. Homepage must be responsive
13. Truncate portfolio score to 4 digits

bucket 10 only add those to cart, BE needs to send the bucket or a flag (revealable)

re: price differences for reveals - I like that and makes sense

top 1%, (pixel rank bucket 10)

.1% of the sorted by rank list (top .1%) 10,000,

revealed? visible, revealer.

responsive

connect page broken

checkout not connected falied?

rank: 1-10,000,000
bucket: 1-10
score 0-1
